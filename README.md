cmonitor
========

A program to monitor CPU and Memory usage and report to an InfluxDB database. 

For now it requires to use dotenv or similar to pass the environ parameters to the script.

Also, we need to install and configure InfluxDB, create username and password and a new database. 

We can use Grafana to see the results.

It is a good exercise to play with a time series database and psutil package.
